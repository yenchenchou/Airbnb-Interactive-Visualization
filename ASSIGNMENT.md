# INF 554 Assignment 5

## Description

Create a presentation with [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr) to pitch your project to the class. Pitch the project in a format similar to the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation format where you show __10 images, each for 20 seconds__. The images advance automatically and you talk along with the images. You cannot use bullet list in any of your slides. The first slide is a cover slide that includes the project title, your group name, your names, and emails (do not add a timer; instead use the first slide to manually start the presentation). In `README.md`, write for each slide your talking points as an itemized list (i.e., with subheaders for Slide 1, Slide 2, ..., Slide 10).

## What to include?

### Cover slide (manual advance not included in time)
Title, group name, names and emails

### Introduction
- Speak simply, lead with 10 words on what your visualization is about
- Who is it addressed to, why it is interesting, important, useful?

### Your visualization
- What is the topic?
- What is the information you plan to present?
- Do you have a story?

### Secret sauce
How your visualization compares to what others have done on the same and different topics?

### What is your plan
- What data you will use?
- Design plans, technology, building and evaluating, risks you identified<br>
- How do you work together?

### Timeline

### The team
Why you are confident you can deliver and the resources you will leverage

## Rubric

|               | Presentation | Project Ideas | Development |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | Slides are in PechaKucha format made using Sozi, are well designed and presented and well described in Readme.md (4-5 pts)| Project audiance, topic, originality, previous and related work, dataset, design, development plan are clearly presented and understood (4-5 pts) | Multiple commits show good use of GIT, slide automation works well, a PDF of the slides is provided (4-5 pts) |
| Competent     | Slides not completely in PechaKucha format, Sozi authoring may be improved, design, presentation and/or description in Readme.md could be improved (2-3 pts) | Project audiance, topic, originality, previous and related work, dataset, design, development not fully and clearly presented and understood (2-3 pts) | Use of GIT, slide automation, and PDF export could be improved (2-3 pts) |
| Needs work   | Slides not in correct PechaKucha format, not authored with Sozi, not well designed, not well designed, presented or described in Readme.md (0-1 pts) | Project audiance, topic, originality, previous and related work, dataset, design, development not fully and clearly presented and understood (0-1 pts) | Unsatisfactory use of GIT, slide automation not implementd, PDF not provided (0-1 pts) |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
- Homework is expected to work in CHROME

## Important Note from Graders

__Ensure that you use the same case when referring to files than the actual filename__ as the homework may be assessed on Linux systems. For example, if an image tag refers to `myFile.png` but the actual filename is `myfile.png`, the image will not appear on the web page in Linux systems. We will deduct points if this happens. Use [Visual Studio Code HTML path completion feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#_html-path-completion) and/or double-check filenames to avoid this problem.
