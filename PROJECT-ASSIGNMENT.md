### Presentation

Presentation__ students will present their projects to the class using the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation format. PechaKucha is a simple presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. You cannot use bullets in any of your slides. The presentation will be created with [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr). Presentations should include the following:

- Cover slide (used to start the presentation manually, not included in time) including title, group name, names and emails
- Introduction leading with 10 words on what your visualization is about. Explain who is it addressed to, why it is interesting, original, useful.
- Explain who did what.
- Explain the data and topic as needed to understand the project.
- Explain the research you have done, what others have done in the same topic, other topics that are relevant.
- Explain how your work is original.
- Explain your design process, rationale for the layout, story, choice of forms, how you optimized the visual queries and user interaction.
- Highlight what you have built and with d3 (see Demonstration for a list of required d3 features to include) and other tools including Bootstrap and framework features you used.
- Explain what you would have done differently.

Use Markdown to create a transcript of your presentation in a file named `PRESENTATION_TRANSCRIPT.md`. Make sure to provide a link in the `README.md` as described in Development.
