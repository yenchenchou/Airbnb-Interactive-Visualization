- Do you have a story?
I prefered to have a deep travlel on a certain state, I selected the place based on the sites you prefer to visit through websites such as booking and trivago to look for the desire places to stay. Then, I had to do it again when I wanted to search for another place. I also had to google it to know the places I booked. So, an idea popped up at that moment, why not showing all the best places at one time according to my need and give a brief overview right away?
